# ember-engines-example

This is a sample application showing Ember Engines in action. It contains the following:

* Two routes:
  * /store
  * /store/pdp
* One service:
  * session

There's also an in-repo addon that serves as an Engine containing:

* Three routes:
  * /cart
  * /confirm
  * /thank-you

Take a look at the code for additional documentation.

Also see [Ember Engines on GitHub](https://github.com/dgeb/ember-engines) for more information on how Engines work.
